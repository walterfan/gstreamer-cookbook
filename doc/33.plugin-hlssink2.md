# Overview

HTTP Live Streaming sink/server. Unlike the old hlssink which took a muxed MPEG-TS stream as input, this element takes elementary audio and video streams as input and handles the muxing internally. 

This allows hlssink2 to make better decisions as to when to start a new fragment and also works better with input streams where there isn't an encoder element upstream that can generate keyframes on demand as needed.

This element only writes fragments and a playlist file into a specified directory, it does not contain an actual HTTP server to serve these files. Just point an external webserver to the directory with the playlist and fragment files.

# Example launch line
```
 gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc is-live=true ! x264enc ! h264parse ! hlssink2 max-files=5
```
