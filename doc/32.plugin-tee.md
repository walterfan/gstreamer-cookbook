# Overview

[tee plugin](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/coreelements/tee.html?gi-language=c) splits data to multiple pads. Branching the data flow is useful when e.g. capturing a video where the video is shown on the screen and also encoded and written to a file. 

Another example is playing music and hooking up a visualisation module.

One needs to use separate queue elements (or a multiqueue) in each branch to provide separate threads for each branch. Otherwise a blocked dataflow in one branch would stall the other branches.

# Example launch line

```
 gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=song.ogg ! decodebin ! tee name=t ! queue ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! autoaudiosink t. ! queue ! audioconvert ! goom ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

Play song.ogg audio file which must be in the current working directory and render visualisations using the goom element (this can be easier done using the playbin element, this is just an example pipeline).
