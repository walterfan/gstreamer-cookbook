# Overview

This plugin draws bounding boxes, text, arrows, lines, circles and region of interest (RoI) polygons. (Polygons are presented as a set of lines.) The plugin accepts an RGBA buffer with attached metadata from the upstream component when CPU process mode. 

It can accepts RGBA/NV12 PL/NV12 BL buffer when GPU process mode. It draws bounding boxes, which may be shaded depending on the configuration (e.g. width, color, and opacity) of a given bounding box. It also draws text and RoI polygons at specified locations in the frame. Text and polygon parameters are configurable through metadata.
